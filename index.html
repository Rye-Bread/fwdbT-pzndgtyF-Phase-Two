<h2>Those-Who-Attack-En-Masse-From-a-Location-Topographically-Quite-High-Above-Terrestria (TWAEMFALTQHAT)</h2>
<ul>
    
<li><strong>Current Issues:</strong>
Cannot get out of cave due to reasons unknown.
sound bugs.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
After crash-landing on earth, you must find the pieces of your equipment so you can
continue the invasion and KILL THE HUMMINS!
</li>

<li><strong>Hardware Platforms:</strong>
Like all the games in this class, it will be browser based, and restricted to
Keyboard-computer based systems, i.e a PC.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Action, Collect, Explore
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player will walk around the world, which contains places to go, such as caves. The
player has limited levitation abilities. The player will explore these caves in order to accomplish the
goal of collecting pieces. There will be the enemies that the player must run from initially, until they
have regained their weapon.
</li>

<li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
I plan to trim down on time requirements by having each area (a phaser state) be
innately resettable (maybe). Each cave will have an index number, and the pieces will be randomly assigned to
index numbers, so when you enter that phaser state the game will spawn the piece on entry (if not
collected) and kill it on exit (if not collected). The primary purpose is to test phaser states and at least
semi-persistent levels through the use of global variables.
</li>

<li><strong>Competition:</strong>
Pretty sure the only competition died 30 something years ago.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place on Earth, where you have crash landed after a rough reentry into the
atmosphere. The humans are not your friends, and would, in fact, like to see you dead.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
After grave losses, you and your invasion fleet defeated the lone ship that was the Earth Defense
Fleet. After descending into the atmosphere, you were taken out by an unexpected anti-air barrage and
crash landed on the surface. They will be looking for you. You must complete your mission.
KILL THE HUMMINS!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Team:</strong>
It's always good to have a second coder, especially one that is proficient in phaser states, which
I plan to make liberal use of. An excellent addition would be someone who is proficient in creating
sprites/sprite-sheets (likely 4bit), as this will be the art style. Sound is secondary and will likely borrow
assets from phaser, and likely royalty free assets from elsewhere.
</li>

<li><strong>Summary:</strong>
In summary I'd like to plan to make a game based around a basic package which can have
“packages” of features added later as time allows. The basic game will involve at least a single screen
with several pits, with only the gun to collect. If time is really short, there will only be four pits with a
piece in each pit. After collection the humans will invade and you must kill them all.
</li>

<li><strong>Content Pack 1:</strong>
There are multiple, preplanned screens (set number of holes with their indexes), and
randomly allocated gun pieces, so the player must look; claw attack.
</li>

<li><strong>Content Pack 2:</strong>
Enemies that will try to kill the player as he searches, multiple kinds of caves.
</li>
    <li><strong>Content Pack 3:</strong>
There is more than just the gun, hopefully both an armor or regenerating health
powerup of some kind, and an enhancer to provide unlimited levitation. (Get with more parts.)
</li>
    <li><strong>Content Pack 4:</strong>
There will be an additional screen where the humans reside. First a suburb then a
military base. The humans will not swarm at the end and instead the player must invade and kill the
humans to win.
</li>
